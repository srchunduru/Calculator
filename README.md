Web Calculator

This is a sample Web calculator application using HTML for design.

The calculation will be performed based on RestAPI structure by calling fetch method from Javascript.

Inmemory DB used to store the date and IP values.As this application is running from localhost the IP
Now logged as 0.0.0.1 which we might get correct when hosted.
DB approach:
Created table.
Stored the values in to table.
Read the values from table.

I am logging the response now in console for IP value.
